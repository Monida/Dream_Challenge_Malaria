The Malaria DREAM Challenge aims to crowdsource the development of predictive models that can aid in monitoring and controlling the spread of artemisinin-resistant strains of the Malaria parasite (Plamodium falciparum). Using a panel of in vitro and in vivo gene expression datasets, contestants are asked to build computational models that can discern between resistant and susceptible strains. Here we present the approaches of our team, Lylat, to address the two SubChallenges (regression and classification) of the Malaria DREAM Challenge. For the first SubChallenge, we built a Kernel Ridge Regression model to predict the IC50 values in a panel of 25 isolates using a set of genes with documented evidence of playing an important role in artemisinin resistance. For the second SubChallenge, we first used a gradient boosted trees method to identify the top most important genes that help in the classification of resistant and non-resistant Malaria parasite strains. From this list, we built a set of 10 classification models which we combine in a voting fashion to yield final predictions.
